# Inheritance
# Definition

Inheritance is one of the key features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (child/derived class) to acquire properties and behaviors of another class (parent/base class).

# Types of Inheritance

Single Inheritance – One derived class inherits from one base class

Multiple Inheritance – One derived class inherits from more than one base class

Multilevel Inheritance – A class is derived from another derived class (forming a chain)

Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class

Hybrid Inheritance – Combination of two or more types of inheritance

# Visibility Modes

Public Inheritance

Protected Inheritance

Private Inheritance

# Key Concepts

Base Class – The class whose members are inherited

Derived Class – The class that inherits members from the base class

Constructor/Destructor in Inheritance

Access Modifiers (public, protected, private)

Function Overriding

Polymorphism through Inheritance

# Advantages

Code reusability

Better organization and modularity

Easier maintenance

Supports polymorphism
